# scraping-pokemons

Scraping pokemons data for client from [site](https://www.cardrush-pokemon.jp).

### Task details

1. Target URLs: [first](https://www.cardrush-pokemon.jp/product-list?keyword=%E3%82%B9%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%96&Submit=%E6%A4%9C%E7%B4%A2&page=1), [second](https://www.cardrush-pokemon.jp/product-list?keyword=%E3%83%97%E3%83%AC%E3%82%A4%E3%83%9E%E3%83%83%E3%83%88&Submit=%E6%A4%9C%E7%B4%A2&page=1)
2. Collect all images / name / price.
3. Upload image to any free image hosting you recommend (I chose imgbb.com because it allows you to upload many images from one IP address).
4. The result should be uploaded to Google Spreadsheet.

### Why imgbb.com?

I chose imgbb.com because it allows you to upload many images from one IP address.
Imgur.com gives you good image management options. But be careful: the upload limit is 40-45 images from one IP.
